# Vehicle-to-Everything-V2X-using-Zigbee
Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communication is a rapidly advancing technology in the modern automotive industry. This evolving technology offers numerous advantages in terms of providing real-time information during driving. Many on-road incidents and accidents stem from inadequate traffic path information, distracted drivers, and poor driving patterns. This paper explores the efficient utilization of Vehicle-to-Everything communication, employing On-Board Units (OBUs) and Roadside Units (RSUs). The OBU and RSU collaboratively share information not only between themselves but also with other OBU-equipped systems, utilizing Zigbee technology an IEEE standard (1609 family) that facilitates low-cost, low-power wireless Machine-to-Machine communication. This approach aims to significantly reduce risks to human life and minimize damage to public assets. The paper provides a detailed explanation of the design and functionality of the device incorporating OBUs and RSUs with Zigbee standards.
Keywordsâ€”V2X, OBU, RSU and ZigBee.
